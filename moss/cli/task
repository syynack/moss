# This file is used to define task stages to be executed within the task.
# Here you will be able to define:
#   - module                The name of the task module to be executed in this stage
#                           (all task modules can be viewed by doing cli.py list-modules).
#
#   - argument              To be used when the task module requires an argument, for
#                           example get_bgp_neighbor requires to neighbor_ip argument.
#
#   - success_outcome       Define either 'success' or 'failure' as the success_outcome, the
#                           default option is 'success'.
#
#   - failure_next_module   Define when you wish the stage to branch to another stage if
#                           an outcome not matching the success_outcome is returned.
#
#   - focus                 Define an element of stdout from the module to focus on.
#                           For example, focus = 'neighbor_rid': 'fd35:1:1:2::8' will
#                           check if there is an occurrence of fd35:1:1:2::8 in stdout,
#                           if there is a match focus_outcome will be marked as True.
#
#   - focus_outcome         Influence the result of the stage from the results of focus.
#
#   - final                 Used to mark the task stage as a final stage. Can be used more
#                           than once.


# Task
task:

# First stage example
- module: 'get_system_uptime'

- module: 'get_system_info'

# Add more stages
